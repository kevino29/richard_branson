            Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson is an English businessman, investor, author and philanthropist. He is
            the creator of the Virgin Group, founded in 1970 which now controls more than 400 subsidiaries. In 2000
            Branson was knighted at Buckingham palace for "services to entrepreneurship" and in 2007, he was named the
            36th most influential person in the world. With a cool networth of 4.1 billion US dollars, Richard Branson
            is now 70 living in London, England.
        </p>

        <p>
            Branson took an interest in entrepreneurship at a young age, at 16 he started a magazine titled "Student"
            having already failed two other business ventures selling Christmas trees and budgerigars (Budgies). Three
            years after launch, or one year after the first issue, Branson's net worth was estimated at Â£50,000. He'd go
            on in his young life to create a mail-order record business and interview many prominent personalities
            including Mick Jagger and R.D. Laing for his magazine.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1970, having made some money from selling magazines and records, Branson launched the "Virgin Group"
            company, which as you know sprouted into Mobile, Atlantic, Hotels and even Galactic just to name a few.
