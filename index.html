            Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson is an English businessman, investor, author and philanthropist. He is
            the creator of the Virgin Group, founded in 1970 which now controls more than 400 subsidiaries. In 2000
            Branson was knighted at Buckingham palace for "services to entrepreneurship" and in 2007, he was named the
            36th most influential person in the world. With a cool networth of 4.1 billion US dollars, Richard Branson
            is now 70 living in London, England.
        </p>

        <p>
            Branson took an interest in entrepreneurship at a young age, at 16 he started a magazine titled "Student"
            having already failed two other business ventures selling Christmas trees and budgerigars (Budgies). Three
            years after launch, or one year after the first issue, Branson's net worth was estimated at £50,000. He'd go
            on in his young life to create a mail-order record business and interview many prominent personalities
            including Mick Jagger and R.D. Laing for his magazine.
        </p>

        <p>
            In 1970, having made some money from selling magazines and records, Branson launched the "Virgin Group"
            company, which as you know sprouted into Mobile, Atlantic, Hotels and even Galactic just to name a few.

                        You speak very highly of delegation, how would you advise a new entrepreneur to go about creating a large business
                        before they have the resources to delegate? Would you recommend a new entrepreneur start with a project of this magnitude?

                <section class="view answer">
                    <p>
                        Delegation is one of the critical aspects of growing your business or organization. You shouldn’t, as a business leader, have
                        to
                        do all the work yourself. You should delegate, lessen your work, free yourself up, and think of the bigger picture. Even if
                        you’re
                        just starting out in the business, delegate. It will help you and the company move forward and think of the future.
                        <br><br>
                        That being said, your amount of delegation can be proportional to your business. In 1967 when I started the Student
                        (Magazine), I
                        had the help of Nik (Powell) and Jonny (Holland-Gems). I wouldn't call this delegation, as Nik and Jonny were my close
                        friends.
                        But, for the small business Student Magazine was, that was all that was needed. Now as my other businesses cropped up, and
                        they
                        started doing okay for themselves, the number of delegates grew alongside them. So I guess, if you're just starting out, and
                        you
                        haven't yet gotten much margin, it will definitely be more difficult to delegate. But get your friends, hire one or two
                        people,
                        and as you grow your enterprise, before you know it, you could be delegating all of your work.
